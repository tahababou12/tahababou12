## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My passion for technology began when I was 11 years old, and it has never stopped growing. I am a senior Computer Engineering at Boston University, where I learn to master the latest technologies and develop diverse programs.

I am always eager to explore new challenges and opportunities and to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world problems. I am also an adventurous person who enjoys golfing, surfing, and photography. I believe that technology can make the world a better place, and I am excited to be part of this journey.
