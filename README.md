## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My passion for technology began when I was 11 years old, and it has never stopped growing. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Boston University, where I learn to master the latest technologies and develop diverse programming skills.

As the Head of Technology Innovation at LOCAL App, I lead the tech strategy for a $20M company that connects travelers with local experiences. I manage a remote international team, scale the mobile application using React Native, TypeScript, NodeJS, and AWS, and represent the company at major industry events. I have also worked as a Technical Lead and a Full Stack Engineer for various projects, leveraging my skills in Node.js, PHP, and AWS.

I am always eager to explore new challenges and opportunities and to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world problems. I am also an adventurous person who enjoys golfing, surfing, and photography. I believe that technology can make the world a better place, and I am excited to be part of this journey.
