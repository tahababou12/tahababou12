### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Quick intro: 
My name is Taha H. Ababou, and I am a Computer Engineer at Boston University with a concentration in Technology Innovation. I have experience in developing and launching websites, leading a diverse team of developers, reducing AWS costs, developing and launching a hybrid e-commerce mobile app, developing a passwordless cryptographic signature login system, and developing an object recognition app for visually impaired or blind individuals. I'm proficient in programming languages such as C/C++, Angular, Python, PHP, React Native, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS, as well as Adobe XD and Photoshop. I'm also fluent in French, Arabic, English, and Spanish. I enjoy playing golf, football (soccer), surfing, movie production, photography, and building software and mechanical projects.

#### Fun bio:

Once upon a time, I was just an 11-year-old kid with big dreams and an insatiable curiosity for technology. Little did I know, this would be the start of an exhilarating journey to becoming the innovative software engineer I am today.

As I ventured into the mystical realm of computer engineering at Boston University, I tamed the wildest subjects like algorithms and operating systems, crafting diverse programming skills. From Junior Technical Lead at The Society of Scent to Senior Technical Lead at Be Local, I wielded my powers to drive growth and user engagement, managing multicultural teams and optimizing AWS resources with ease.

Away from the world of code, I am a true adventurer, conquering golf courses, riding the waves, and capturing breathtaking moments through my lens. This is my story, and it's only just begun!
